# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science! 👩🏻‍💻🔐
- I am taking STATS 220 because I'm interested in learning other programming languages that allow me to be more creative! ฅ^._.^ฅ 
- I am interested in learning about making data feel digestible and not feel so heavy while making it look visually appealing! 😍

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://tenor.com/pmUuGS2LqE4.gif)
