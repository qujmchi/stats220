# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220!


## Who am I and why am I here?

- I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science! 👩🏻‍💻🔐
- I am taking STATS 220 because I'm interested in learning other programming languages that allow me to be **more creative**! ฅ^._.^ฅ 
- I am interested in learning about making data feel **digestible** and not feel so *heavy* while making it look visually appealing! 😍


### But, why computer science?
1. The world is evolving and adapting so quick to tech and being safe in cyberspace is **more critical than ever**.
2. It's a qualification that is widely accepted around the world (*or at least I was told...*)
3. It suited my learning style and it was something I could see myself enjoying!

As I progress into my last year at university, this is how it has me feeling:
