## Analysis of My Daily Distractions

This data tracks how often I get distracted, with the types of distraction, how often I'm distracted for, and the activities that make me vulnerable to being distracted.

For my dynamic report, I will be analysing the data collected based on my daily distractions as a university student who often stays at home. My dataset records the type of distraction, the duration of each distraction, and what I was doing prior to being distracted.

### Summary values

In this section, I will extract code where I have identified a total of 4 summary values using summary methods, and two bar graphs to visually present my findings.

The **minimum** distraction duration is `r min_duration` minutes.

The **maximum** distraction duration is `r max_duration` minutes.

The **average** distraction duration is `r round(mean_duration, 2)` minutes.

The **total** distraction duration is `r total_duration` minutes.

<!-- dynamic comment --> 

```{r dynamic-comments, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dynamic_comment1 <- paste("The shortest recorded distraction lasted", min_duration, 
                          "minutes, while the longest lasted", max_duration, "minutes.")
print(dynamic_comment1)

dynamic_comment2 <- paste("In total, I lost", total_duration, "minutes to distractions, averaging",
                          round(mean_duration, 2), "minutes per distraction.")
print(dynamic_comment2)

```

With these values, it has shown me how much time I spend being distracted, and also how much time I lose being off-track.

#### Frequency of Distractions

For the **first** bar graph, this visualizes the different forms of distraction that took my attention, helping me identify how often each type distracts me and which is the most common.

```{r exploration, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# --------------------------------
#    First bar graph - Different things that diverted my attention the most (Distraction Type vs Frequency)

bargraph_1 <- latest_data %>%
  separate_rows(distraction_type, sep = ", (?=[A-Z])") %>% # Separates values by commas but not the variable "Noise from outside (e.g. cars, rain, birds)"
  ggplot(aes(y = distraction_type)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#ffb3d2") +
  labs(title = "What different forms of distraction took my attention?",
       subtitle = "The different types of distractions and their frequency",
       x = "Frequency",
       y = "Form of Distraction") + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 10, by = 1)) + theme_minimal()

bargraph_1

# Methods used: separate_rows(), regex, ggplot(), aes(), geom_bar(), labs()
# Line 45: Swapped name variables to axis-y for clearer readability of names as they overlap and don't wrap if it were in x-axis
# Line 50.a: Used "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63003022/change-scale-on-x-axis-in-ggplot-in-r" to modify numeric axis scale
# Line 50.b: Used "https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html" to apply themes to bar graph
```

#### Duration of Distractions

For the **second** bar graph, this visualizes the total duration of each distraction type, helping me identify which type of distraction takes up most of my time.

```{r exploration2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# --------------------------------
#    Second bar graph - How long did different things distract me for in 3 days (Distraction Type vs Duration)

duration_summary <- latest_data %>%
  separate_rows(distraction_type, sep = ", (?=[A-Z])") %>% 
  group_by(distraction_type) %>%
  summarize(total_duration = sum(distraction_duration, na.rm = TRUE))

bargraph_2 <- ggplot(duration_summary, 
                     aes(x = total_duration, y = distraction_type)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#ade7f7") +
  labs(title = "How long was I distracted?",
       subtitle = "Total duration of each distraction within 3 days",
       x = "Total Duration (in minutes)",
       y = "Form of Distraction") +
  geom_text(aes(label = total_duration), 
            hjust = -0.2,  
            size = 3) +
  theme_minimal()

bargraph_2

# Methods used: separate_rows(), regex, ggplot(), aes(), geom_col(), labs(), sum()
# Additional methods used: group_by(), summarize()
  # Sourced from: "https://builtin.com/data-science/grouping-r"
# Line (69): Both axes are named with two variables
# Used "https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_text.html" for Line X to label bars as some
# values are very close together and difficult to differentiate
